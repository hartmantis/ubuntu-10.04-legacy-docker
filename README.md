Ubuntu 10.04 Legacy Docker Container
====================================

The Lucid repos recently disappeared from security.ubuntu.com, but its
doubtful the official container will ever be updated, so let's do a custom
build converted over to the legacy Ubuntu repos.

Contributing
============

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Add tests for the new feature; ensure they pass (`rake`)
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
6. Create a new Pull Request
